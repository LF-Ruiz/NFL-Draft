The NFL draft is right around the corner, and team 1 is diving in early!  As three members of our team collaborated on the ETL project and created a database of the past 5 NFL drafts, we thought it was only fitting to see the project through.  
To do this we plan on creating a dashboard that proves to be a clean and interactive experience for the end user.  We hope that the serious and casual NFL draft fan alike will be able to visit our dashboard and glean the information they are looking for. 
A couple of ideas we have (but are not limited to):
1.	Bar graphs that will show the number of players drafted at each position (User defines draft year)
2.	Line graphs that show average draft pick of each position over the past 5 drafts (User defines position)
3.	Bar graph that shows number the average, min and max of combine events statistics.
4.	Radar graph that shows the average of all comine events in one chart by position.5.
